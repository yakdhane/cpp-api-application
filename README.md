Sure, here's a sample README.md file:

# API Application

This is a C++ based API application that consists of 6 components. Each component is defined in a separate file and the main program calls functions from each component to perform a specific task.

## Dependencies

To run this application, you need to have `g++` installed on your system. You can install it by running the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install g++
```

## Running the Program

To run the program, navigate to the directory where the files are located and run the following command:

```
g++ -o app main.cpp component1.cpp component2.cpp component3.cpp component4.cpp component5.cpp
./app
```

## Running the Program using Docker

To run the program using Docker, you need to have Docker installed on your system. You can install it by following the instructions on the official Docker website.

Once you have Docker installed, navigate to the directory where the files are located and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t api-app .
```

After the image is built, you can run the program using the following command:

```
docker run api-app
```
